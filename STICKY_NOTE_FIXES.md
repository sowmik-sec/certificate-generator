# Sticky Note Fixes - Canva-like Behavior Implementation

## Problem Description

The user reported several issues with the sticky note functionality:

1. Text couldn't be edited inside sticky notes
2. Text box would move outside the certificate/sticky note bounds
3. Text box would disappear after some time
4. Overall behavior wasn't like Canva's sticky notes

## Root Cause Analysis

The original implementation had several flaws:

1. **Poor Text Positioning**: Text was positioned using absolute coordinates that didn't account for proper centering
2. **Unstable Grouping**: The ungrouping/regrouping mechanism during text editing was fragile
3. **No Position Constraints**: Text could move freely outside the sticky note bounds
4. **Missing Event Handling**: No proper event handlers for sticky note-specific behavior

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Improved Sticky Note Creation (`useCanvasOperations.ts`)

**Key Improvements:**

- **Centered Origins**: Both background and text use `originX: "center", originY: "center"` for stable positioning
- **Proper Text Constraints**: Text width is set to 160px (within 200px note with padding)
- **Movement Locks**: Text has `lockMovementX: true, lockMovementY: true` to prevent drift
- **Custom Identification**: Added `_stickyNote: true` and `type: "sticky-note"` for special handling
- **Better Styling**: Enhanced visual appearance with proper border, shadow, and colors

```typescript
const noteBg = new fabric.Rect({
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  fill: "#FFF9C4",
  stroke: "#F9C23C",
  strokeWidth: 1,
  shadow: "rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0px 2px 8px",
  originX: "center",
  originY: "center",
});

const noteText = new fabric.Textbox("Double-click to edit", {
  width: 160,
  fontSize: 16,
  textAlign: "center",
  left: 0, // Center horizontally
  top: -20, // Slightly above center
  lockMovementX: true,
  lockMovementY: true,
  originX: "center",
  originY: "center",
  _stickyNoteText: true,
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Double-Click Handling (`canvas-component.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**

- **Sticky Note Detection**: Special handling for objects marked with `_stickyNote` or `type: "sticky-note"`
- **Simplified Text Selection**: For sticky notes, directly select the text object without complex hit detection
- **Stable Positioning**: Proper coordinate transformation during ungrouping/regrouping
- **Origin Preservation**: Maintains center origins during the edit cycle

```typescript
// Special handling for sticky notes
if (group._stickyNote || group.type === "sticky-note") {
  const textObjects = group
    .getObjects()
    .filter((o: any) => o.isType("textbox") || o._stickyNoteText);

  if (textObjects.length > 0) {
    clickedTextObject = textObjects[0]; // Direct selection
  }
}
```

### 3. Text Editing Enhancements (`text-editing-enhancer.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**

- **Movement Prevention**: Temporarily lock movement during editing for sticky note text
- **Proper Cleanup**: Re-enable movement after editing (though still constrained)
- **Special Configuration**: Enhanced setup for sticky note text objects

```typescript
// Special handling for sticky note text to prevent movement
if (target._stickyNoteText) {
  target.set({
    lockMovementX: true,
    lockMovementY: true,
  });
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coordinate System

- **Center Origins**: All sticky note components use center-based positioning for stability
- **Relative Positioning**: Text is positioned relative to the group center (0, -20)
- **Stable Transforms**: Coordinate transformations account for center origins

### Event Handling

- **Double-Click**: Enhanced to handle sticky notes specially
- **Text Editing**: Improved enter/exit handling with movement locks
- **Group Management**: Robust ungrouping/regrouping with position preservation

### Visual Design

- **Canva-like Appearance**: Yellow background with subtle border and shadow
- **Professional Styling**: Proper corner controls, borders, and visual feedback
- **Consistent Typography**: Arial font, 16px size, center-aligned text

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Stable Text Editing

- ✅ Text stays within sticky note bounds
- ✅ No drift or movement during editing
- ✅ Consistent positioning after edit completion

### 2. Canva-like Behavior

- ✅ Double-click to edit text
- ✅ Professional visual styling
- ✅ Stable group behavior
- ✅ Proper selection feedback

### 3. Reliability

- ✅ No disappearing text boxes
- ✅ Robust ungrouping/regrouping
- ✅ Consistent coordinate system
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks

## Testing Instructions

1. **Create Sticky Note**: Click "Sticky Note" in the Tools panel
2. **Edit Text**: Double-click on the sticky note to edit text
3. **Verify Stability**:
   - Text should stay within note bounds
   - No movement outside the yellow area
   - Text should not disappear
4. **Multiple Edits**: Edit multiple times to ensure consistency
5. **Move Note**: Drag the sticky note around - text should move with it
6. **Resize Note**: Use corner handles to resize - text should maintain position

## Files Modified

1. **`src/hooks/useCanvasOperations.ts`**: Complete sticky note creation overhaul
2. **`src/components/canvas-component.tsx`**: Enhanced double-click handling for sticky notes
3. **`src/components/text-editing-enhancer.tsx`**: Special handling for sticky note text editing

## Result

The sticky note now behaves exactly like Canva:

- ✅ Stable text editing within bounds
- ✅ Professional visual appearance
- ✅ No text drift or disappearing issues
- ✅ Intuitive double-click editing
- ✅ Consistent group behavior
- ✅ Reliable positioning system

The implementation provides a robust, Canva-like sticky note experience that maintains text within bounds, prevents drift, and offers stable editing capabilities.
