# Certificate Generator Fixes - Sticky Note and Table Functionality

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sticky Note Text Editing Issue
**Problem**: Users could not edit text inside sticky notes because the text was grouped with the background rectangle, making it non-editable.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the canvas component to handle double-click events on grouped objects
- When a user double-clicks on a grouped object (like sticky note), the system:
  1. Finds text objects within the group
  2. Temporarily ungroups the objects
  3. Allows the user to edit the text
  4. Re-groups the objects after editing is complete

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/canvas-component.tsx` - Added double-click event handler for group text editing
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Fixed sticky note creation with proper styling

### 2. Table Customization Issue
**Problem**: Tables were hardcoded to be 2x2 grids with no option to customize the number of rows and columns.

**Solution**:
- Modified the `addTable` function to accept parameters for rows and columns
- Updated the tools panel to include input controls for table dimensions
- Added validation to ensure minimum values and reasonable maximum limits (1-10 for both rows and cols)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated `addTable` function to accept row/column parameters
- `src/components/tools-pannel.tsx` - Added UI controls for table customization

### 3. Table Cell Editing Issue
**Problem**: Only the first cell in tables could be edited; other cells were not responsive to double-clicks.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the double-click detection algorithm to accurately identify which specific text object was clicked within a group
- Implemented coordinate transformation to convert global click coordinates to local group coordinates
- Added fallback logic to find the closest text object if precise hit detection fails
- Improved error handling and logging for debugging

**Technical Details**:
- Uses Fabric.js transformation matrices to accurately map click coordinates
- Calculates distances to find the nearest text object as a fallback
- Maintains robust ungrouping/regrouping functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/canvas-component.tsx` - Enhanced click detection for multiple text objects in groups

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
**Improvements Made**:
- Better styling for table controls with proper focus states and transitions
- Improved text alignment in both sticky notes and table cells (centered by default)
- Added input validation to prevent invalid table dimensions
- Enhanced visual feedback for interactive elements

## How It Works Now

### Sticky Notes
1. Click "Sticky Note" button to create a sticky note
2. Double-click on the sticky note to edit the text
3. The background and text temporarily separate during editing
4. After finishing text editing (clicking outside or pressing Escape), they regroup automatically

### Tables
1. In the Tools panel, you'll see table controls with:
   - Rows input (1-10)
   - Columns input (1-10)
   - "Add Table" button
2. Set your desired dimensions and click "Add Table"
3. Double-click on any cell to edit its text content
4. Each cell maintains proper alignment and formatting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Group Text Editing Mechanism
The solution uses Fabric.js's grouping/ungrouping capabilities:

```javascript
// On double-click:
1. Detect if clicked object is a group
2. Find text objects within the group  
3. Store original group properties
4. Ungroup and add individual objects to canvas
5. Enter text editing mode
6. On editing exit, regroup objects with original properties
```

### Table Generation
Dynamic table creation based on user input:

```javascript
const addTable = (rows: number, cols: number) => {
  // Create cells and text objects in nested loops
  // Group all objects together
  // Add to canvas as a single grouped object
}
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **To create a sticky note**: Go to Tools → Click "Sticky Note"
2. **To edit sticky note text**: Double-click on the sticky note
3. **To create a custom table**: Go to Tools → Set rows/cols → Click "Add Table"
4. **To edit table cell text**: Double-click on any cell

The interface now behaves like professional design tools such as Canva, providing intuitive text editing within grouped objects.
